# Jasbot-site
This repo is a repo of [Jasbot's site](https://jasbot.senghong.xyz). There are better ways to acheive the same goal, but I did it this way for expandibility in the future and my lack of knowledge in discord's api. I ended up using quick.db, because of data integrity. Meaning that if the token is broken or something just went wong, at least the value is in a db somewhere.

# How to use:

```
npm i
npm update
npm run deploy
```


```
.env file

token = tokenHere
port = portHere
```
